    <h3> Settings </h3>
    <p> Welcome to the Settings Page! This page is created to make this website  behave
        the way you want. We have the a theme toggle which allows you (users) to be able to switch between light and dark mode to reduce eye strain,
        a sound toggle to turn off the sounds to ensure that your ears wont strain, a study timer which is designed to act like
        a Pomodoro Timer to ensure that you are still able to take breaks in between your study hours, and a reset button to reset everything.
    </p>

    <p> The settings page is created to suit your preferences and ensure you are comfortable while visiting our website. We have used JavaScript for
        every one of them and please do not hesitate to inform us if there are any issues with the code as we'd be more than happy to help you understand
        and have fun with our websites :).
